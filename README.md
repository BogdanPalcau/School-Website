A lightweight Learning Management System built with PHP and SQLite for Rangoon International Education Online.

It's a single, central place for students, teachers, supervisors, and admins to handle everything from course materials and submissions to schedules, discussions, and academic integrity reviews — without needing a dozen different tools bolted together.

This project started as a full-stack web app built with a real focus on education, usability, role-based access control, and keeping course data handled securely.
